##JADE

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/7197c9d3255543d39ec9a15623ee0e51)](https://www.codacy.com/app/codesardine/Jadesktop?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=codesardine/Jadesktop&utm_campaign=badger)

JADE is a serveless linux desktop, built with Python and web techonlogies on top of Webkit2 using the Gtk toolkit, the front end is build using HTML5, Javascript, and CSS.
JADE is under the GPL license, and backgrounds images are under [Creative Commons Zero license](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

JADE is a modern DE. Jade does not try to hide things way from the user, and reduces nested clicking for a modern workflow. Jade is not meant to be a full blown DE, and is meant to be complemented by 3rd party applications.

At the moment it only offers basic functionality, runs applications, shuts down your system, allows access to recently used files, provides application search, displays the current time and total disk usage in a pleasant way to the user. 

### Why web techonlogies?

Most ( Non-Technical ) people dont know how to use a computer properly, most dont know what linux is or that they carry it in their pockets in a daily basis. But they all have one thing in common, they all use the browser to buy, go to social networks or check their email. Making JADE using familiar interfaces and technologies, makes it easy to use independent of the skill level.

### Why did i build this?

I built JADE out of my desire of learning python and i was in need of an interface for my personal use, in the living room PC that was easy to use and hack into. Later on i decided to adapt Jade for desktop use. I decided to release Jade, maybe someone else will like to use it.

This is a Protoype desktop, developer build preview, and it is unfinished. JADE is subject to changes at any time and is not ready for daily use.

I only got packages available for Manjaro Linux or archlinux based distros, if you got something else you have to use git clone and install manualy or make your own distro packages.

* paper-icon-theme-git ( available in the aur )

Jade can be run as normal application window, or as a Desktop Enviroment by selecting the window type hint in the manifest file.

Development:

I will be adding more functionality as i need it without bloat, as i want it simple and snappy. If you have an idea that is a good fit open an issue. 

If there is something you can't find or do inside the interface open an issue, as i consider interface design problems a bug.

If you find a problem in the code open an issue.

Issues might take me a while to resolve but i will eventually fix them when i get spare time.
